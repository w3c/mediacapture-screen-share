        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document describes an extension to the Media Capture API [[GETUSERMEDIA]] that enables
        the acquisition of a user's display, or part thereof, in the form of a video track. In some
        cases system, application or window audio is also captured which is presented in the form
        of an audio track. This enables a number of applications, including screen sharing using
        WebRTC [[WEBRTC]].
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature has signficant security implications. Applications that use this API to access
        information that is displayed to users could access confidential information from other
        origins if that information is under the control of the application. This includes content
        that would otherwise be inaccessible due to the protections offered by the user agent
        sandbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document concerns itself primarily with the capture of video and audio [[GETUSERMEDIA]],
        but the general mechanisms defined here could be extended to other types of media, of which
        depth [[MEDIACAPTURE-DEPTH]] is currently defined.

      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the
        <dfn data-lt="user agents">user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
        contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]] to implement the APIs defined in this
        specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings
        defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that
        specification and terminology.

        Terminology
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the definition of {{MediaStream}}, {{MediaStreamTrack}},
        {{MediaStreamConstraints}} and {{ConstrainablePattern}}
        from [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Screen capture encompasses the capture of several different types of screen-based surfaces.
        Collectively, these are referred to as <dfn data-lt="display surface">display
        surfaces</dfn>, of which this document defines the following types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <dfn>monitor</dfn> <a>display surface</a> represents a physical display. Some systems
        have multiple <a>monitor</a>s, which can be identified separately. Multiple <a>monitor</a>s
        might also be aggregated into a single logical <a>monitor</a>. An aggregated <a>display
        surface</a> is captured as a single {{MediaStreamTrack}}.
        </li>
        <li>A <dfn data-lt="windows">window</dfn> <a>display surface</a> is a single contiguous
        surface that is used by a single application.
        </li>
        <li>A single application might have several <a>windows</a> available to it, and those can
        be aggregated into a single <dfn>application</dfn> surface, representing all the windows
        available to that application and therefore presented as a single
        {{MediaStreamTrack}}.
        </li>
        <li>A <dfn>browser</dfn> <a>display surface</a> is the rendered form of a
        [=browsing context=].
        This is not strictly limited to HTML [[HTML]] documents, though the discussion in this
        document will address some specific concerns with the capture of HTML.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This document draws a distinction between two variants of each type of display surface:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <dfn data-lt="logical display surfaces">logical display surface</dfn> is the surface
        that an operating system makes available to an application for the purposes of rendering.
        </li>
        <li>a <dfn>visible display surface</dfn> is the portion of a [=logical display surface=]
        that is rendered to a [=monitor=].
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some operating systems permit windows from different applications to occlude other windows,
        in whole or part, so the <a>visible display surface</a> is a strict subset of the
        <a>logical display surface</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>source pixel ratio</dfn> of a <a>display surface</a> is 1/96th of 1 inch divided
        by its vertical pixel size.
      </p>

      <p>The <dfn>devicechange</dfn> event is defined in [[GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>

      <p>
        Capture of displayed media is enabled through the addition of a new
        {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia}} method on the {{MediaDevices}}
        interface, that is similar to {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}
        , except that it acquires media from one display device
        chosen by the end-user each time.

            <p>Prompts the user for permission to live-capture their display.</p>
            <p>
              The user agent MUST let the end-user choose which display surface to share
              out of all available choices every time, and MUST NOT use
              <var>constraints</var> to limit that choice. Instead,
              <var>constraints</var> MUST be applied to the media chosen by the user,
              only after they have made their selection. This prevents an application
              from influencing the selection of sources, see <a href="#constraints"></a>
              for details.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of audio, the user agent MAY present the end-user with audio sources
              to share. Which choices are available to choose from is up to the user agent, and
              the audio source(s) are not necessarily the same as the video source(s). An audio
              source may be a particular <a>application</a>, <a>window</a>, <a>browser</a>, the
              entire system audio or any combination thereof. Unlike
              {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} with regards to audio+video, the user agent is
              allowed not to return audio even if the audio constraint is present. If the user
              agent knows no audio will be shared for the lifetime of the stream it MUST NOT
              include an audio track in the resulting stream. The user agent MAY accept a
              request for audio and video by only returning a video track in the resulting
              stream, or it MAY accept the request by returning both an audio track and a video
              track in the resulting stream. The user agent MUST reject audio-only requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to drawing from a different set of sources and requiring user selection,
              {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia}} also differs from
              {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} in that {{PermissionState/"granted"}} permissions cannot be persisted.
            </p>
            <p>When the {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}}
            method is called, the user agent MUST run the following
            steps:</p>

        <li>Define <var>any&lt;kind&gt;Accessible</var> (e.g.

      <p>Then, given the new definitions above, the requirements on the user

        Security and Permissions
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section is informative; however, it notes some serious risks to platform security if
        the advice it contains are not adhered to.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        This is consistent with other documents, but the absence of strong normative language here
        is a little worrying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The risks to user privacy and security posed by capture of displayed content are twofold.
        The immediate and obvious risk is that users inadvertently share content that they did not
        wish to share, or might not have realized would be shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Display capture presents a less obvious risk to the cross site request forgery protections
        offered by the browser sandbox. Display and capture of information that is also under the
        control of an application, even indirectly, can allow that application to access
        information that would otherwise by inaccessible to it directly. For example, the canvas
        API does not permit sampling of a canvas, or conversion to an accessible form if it is not
        origin-clean [[2DCONTEXT]].
      </p>
      <p>
        This issue is discussed in further detail in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]] and
        [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Display capture that includes browser windows, particularly those that are under any form
        of control by the application, risks violation of these basic security protections. This
        risk is not entirely contained to browser windows, since control channels between browser
        applications and other applications, depending on the operating system. The key
        consideration is whether the captured <a>display surface</a> could be somehow induced to
        present information that would otherwise be secret from the application that is receiving
        the resulting media.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Capturing Logical or Visible Display Surfaces
        </h2>
        <p>
          Capture of <a>logical display surfaces</a> causes there to be a potential for content to
          be shared that a user is not made aware of. A <a>logical display surface</a> might render
          information that a user did not intend to expose. This can be more easily recognized if
          this information is visible. Such means are likely ineffectual against a machine, but a
          human recipient is less able to process content that appears only briefly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information that is not currently rendered to the screen SHOULD be obscured in captures
          unless the application has been specifically authorized to access that content (this
          might require <a>elevated permissions</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          How obscured areas of the <a>logical display surface</a> are captured to produce a
          <a>visible display surface</a> capture MAY vary. Some applications, like presentation
          software, benefit from having obscured portions of the screen render the image that
          appeared prior to being obscured. Freezing images can cause visual artifacts for changing
          content, or hide the fact that content is being obscured. Note that frozen portions of a
          capture can be incorrectly perceived as a bug. Alternatively, obscured areas might be
          replaced with content that marks them as being obscured, such as a grey color or
          hatching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some systems MAY only capture the <a>logical display surface</a>. Devices with small
          screens, for instance, do not typically have the concept of a <a>window</a>, and render
          applications in full screen modes only. These systems might provide a capture of an
          application that is not currently visible, which could be unusable without capturing the
          <a>logical display surface</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important consideration when capturing a <a>window</a> or other <a>display surface</a>
          that is partially transparent is that content from the background might be shared. A
          <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT capture content from the background of a captured <a>display
          surface</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a risk that the user prompt be exposed to the web page for a short amount of time
          by the newly created {{MediaStreamTrack}}, for instance if the user
          selects the screen on which the user prompt is displayed.
          In the case the user prompt displays previews of the various surfaces available for selection,
          the <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT capture, for the newly created {{MediaStreamTrack}},
          the previews that the user did not intend to share explicitly.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Capturing Audio
        </h2>
        <p>
          {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia}} allows capturing audio alongside video, this poses
          privacy and security concern as this may expose additional information about system
          applications, and the set of shared audio sources are not necessarily the same as the set
          of shared video sources. For example, a <a>user agent</a> MAY be capturing the video of a
          <a>window</a> and capture the audio of the entire system, including applications
          unrelated to that window. The <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT share audio without <a>active
          user consent</a>. It is important that the user is aware of what content will be shared,
          including any possible audio. It is strongly recommended that the user is allowed to give
          consent to video but not audio, resulting in a video-only stream. This ensures that the
          request for audio is always optional and does not restrict the user's choices compared to
          a video-only request.

          Authorizing Display Capture
        </h2>
        <p>
          This document provides recommends that implementations provide additional limitations on
          the mechanisms used to affirm user consent. These limitations are designed to mitigate
          the security and privacy risks that the API poses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two forms of consent interaction are described: <a>active user consent</a> and a range of
          <a>elevated permissions</a>. These are non-normative recommandations only.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>
            Active User Consent
          </h2>
          <p>
            <dfn>Active user consent</dfn> is sufficient where there is little or no risk of an
            application gaining information that the user did not intend to share. These cases can
            be identified by those where the application that requests capture has no control over
            what is rendered to the captured <a>display surface</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prevent applications from limiting the available choices presented to a user with
            the goal of promoting a particular choice, the {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia}} API
            does not permit the use of constraints to narrow the set of options presented.

          <h2>
            Elevated Permissions
          </h2>
          <p>
            It is strongly advised that <dfn>elevated permissions</dfn> be required to access any
            <a>display surface</a> that might be used to circumvent cross-origin protections for
            content. The key goal of this consent process is not just to demonstrate that a user
            intends to share content, but to also to determine that the user exhibits an elevated
            level of trust in the application that is being granted access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several different controls might be provided to grant <a>elevated permissions</a>. This
            section describes several different capabilities that could be independently granted. A
            <a>user agent</a> might opt to prohibit access to any capability that requires
            <a>elevated permissions</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If access to these surfaces is supported, it is strongly advised that any mechanism to
            acquire <a>elevated permissions</a> not rely solely on simple prompts for user consent.
            Any action needs to ensure that a decision to authorize an application with elevated
            privileges is deliberate. For instance, a <a>user agent</a> might require a process
            equivalent to software installation to signify that user consent for <a>elevated
            permissions</a> is granted.
          </p>
          <p>
            An <a>elevated permissions</a> experience could allow the <a>user agent</a> to
            communicate the risks associated with enabling this feature, or at least to convey the
            need for augmented trust in the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that <a>elevated permissions</a> are not a substitute for <a>active user
            consent</a>. It is advised that <a>user agents</a> still present users with the ability
            to select what is shared, even for applications that have <a>elevated permissions</a>.

        <section>
          <h2>
            Capabilities Depending on Elevated Permissions
          </h2>
          <p>
            <a>Elevated permissions</a> are recommended as a prerequisite for access to capture of
            <a>monitor</a> or <a>browser</a> <a>display surfaces</a>. Note that capture of a
            complete <a>monitor</a> is included because this could include a window from the
            <a>user agent</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, <a>elevated permissions</a> are a recommended prerequisite for access to
            <a>logical display surfaces</a>, where that would not ordinarily be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <a>user agent</a> SHOULD persist any <a>elevated permissions</a> that are granted to
            an origin. An <a>elevated permissions</a> process in part relies on its novelty to
            ensure that it correctly captures user intent.

        <h2>
          Feedback and Interface During Capture
        </h2>
        <p>
          Implementations are advised to provide user feedback and control mechanisms similar to
          those offered users when sharing a camera or microphone, as recommended in
          [[GETUSERMEDIA]].
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important that a user be aware that content is being shared when content is
          actively being captured. <a>User agents</a> are advised to display a prominent indicator
          while content is being captured. In addition to an indicator, a <a>user agent</a> is
          advised to provide a means to learn precisely what is being shared; while this capability
          is trivially provided by an application by rendering the captured content, this
          information allows a user to accurately assess what is being shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to feedback mechanisms, a means to for the user to stop any active capture is
          advisable.
