        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document describes an extension to the Media Capture API [[GETUSERMEDIA]] that enables
        the acquisition of a user's display, or part thereof, in the form of a video stream. This
        enables a number of applications, including screen sharing using WebRTC [[WEBRTC]].
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature has signficant security implications. Applications that use this API to access
        information that is displayed to users could access confidential information from other
        origins if that information is under the control of the application. This includes content
        that would otherwise be inaccessible due to the protections offered by the user agent
        sandbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document concerns itself primarily with the capture of video, but the general
        mechanisms defined here could be extended to other types of media, of which audio
        [[GETUSERMEDIA]] and depth [[MEDIACAPTURE-DEPTH]] are currently defined.

        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the

      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]] to implement the APIs defined in this
        specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings
        defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that

        Terminology
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the definition of <code><dfn><a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#navigatorusermedia">NavigatorUserMedia</a></dfn></code>,
        <code><dfn><a href=

        and <code><dfn><a href=

      <p>
        Screen capture encompasses the capture of several different types of screen-based surfaces.
        Collectively, these are referred to as <dfn data-lt="display surface">display
        surfaces</dfn>, of which this document defines the following types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <dfn>monitor</dfn> <a>display surface</a> represents a physical display. Some systems
        have multiple <a>monitor</a>s, which can be identified separately. Multiple <a>monitor</a>s
        might also be aggregated into as a single logical <a>monitor</a>. An aggregated <a>display
        surface</a> is captured as a single <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>.
        </li>
        <li>A <dfn data-lt="windows">window</dfn> <a>display surface</a> is a single contiguous
        surface that is used by a single application.
        </li>
        <li>A single application might have several <a>windows</a> available to it, and those can
        be aggregated into a single <dfn>application</dfn> surface, representing all the windows
        available to that application and therefore presented as a single
        <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>.
        </li>
        <li>A <dfn>browser</dfn> <a>display surface</a> is the rendered form of a single document.
        This is not strictly limited to HTML [[HTML5]] documents, though the discussion in this
        document will address some specific concerns with the capture of HTML.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This document draws a distinction between two variants of each type of display surface:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <dfn data-lt="logical display surfaces">logical display surface</dfn> is the surface
        that an operating system makes available to an application for the purposes of rendering.
        </li>
        <li>a <dfn>visible display surface</dfn> is the portion of a <a>logical display surface</a>
        that is rendered to a <a>monitor</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some operating systems permit windows from different applications to occlude other windows,
        in whole or part, so the <a>visible display surface</a> is a strict subset of the
        <a>logical display surface</a>.

        Capture of displayed media is enabled through the addition of a new
        <code><a>getDisplayMedia</a></code> method on the <code><a>NavigatorUserMedia</a></code>
        interface, that is similar to <code><dfn><a href=

        <p>
          Though all constraints are supported for display device capture, not all constraints will
          have an effect. Usually, this is because a display device cannot alter its behavior in a
          way that the constraint implies, just as a video camera cannot alter <a href=

          New Constraints for Captured Display Surfaces

        <p>
          Two constraints are defined that allow an application to observe properties of the
          selected <a>display surface</a>. Since the source of media cannot be changed after a
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> has been returned and constraints do not affect the

          application.

        <p>
          The <code><a data-link-for="MediaTrackConstraintSet">displaySurface</a></code> constraint

          captured.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code><a data-link-for="MediaTrackConstraintSet">logicalSurface</a></code> constraint
          allows an application to observe whether the surface that is captured is a <a>logical

            <p>Following lists few non-normative recommendations for supporting full screen
              rendering of an application/window.
            </p>
            <p>
              For applications that support full screen rendering, like powerpoint for example, 
              the decision of the display surface that gets rendered in full screen is 
              specific to <a>user agent</a> implementation. For consistency reasons, 
              an <a>user agent</a> must ensure that the display surface rendered in full screen 
              can be unambigously mapped to the application/window where the action was triggered 
              in the first place. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The choice of <code><a>DisplayCaptureSurfaceType</a></code> and 
              <code><a data-link-for="MediaTrackConstraintSet">logicalSurface</a></code> may 
              influence actions for performing full screen rendering. For example, when an 
              application/window is triggered to go full screen and application has 
              "monitor" DisplayCaptureSurfaceType selected, the choice of "monitor" 
              display surface to capture the displayed media is solely left to the 
              <a>user agent</a>, especially when there are mutliple options available. 
            </p>

            <p>
             An <a>user agent</a> must be prepared to handle certain transient behavior where 
             the action to render an application/window in full screen may be reverted, say by
             user canceling the action immediately. In these scenarios, the <a>user agent</a>
             should ensure the captured display suface is restored to the application/window 
             for which such action was triggered.

          Each potential source of capture is treated by this API as a discrete media source.
          However, display capture sources MUST NOT be enumerated by <code><a href=
          "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#widl-MediaDevices-enumerateDevices-Promise-sequence-MediaDeviceInfo">
          enumerateDevices</a></code>, since this would reveal too much information about the host
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Display capture sources therefore cannot be selected with the <code>deviceId</code>
          constraint, since this would allow applications to influence selection; setting
          <code>deviceId</code> constraint can only cause the resulting
          <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> to become overconstrained.
        </p>
        <p>
          A display capture source is represented in the <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> API
          as having <code>deviceId</code> and <code>groupId</code> attributes that are randomized
          each time a <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> is connected. These values cannot
          duplicate any existing values.

        This section is informative; however, it notes some serious risks to platform security if
        the advice it contains are not adhered to.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        This is consistent with other documents, but the absence of strong normative language here
        is a little worrying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The risks to user privacy and security posed by capture of displayed content are twofold.
        The immediate and obvious risk is that users inadvertently share content that they did not
        wish to share, or might not have realized would be shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Display capture presents a less obvious risk to the cross site request forgery protections
        offered by the browser sandbox. Display and capture of information that is also under the
        control of an application, even indirectly, can allow that application to access
        information that would otherwise by inaccessible to it directly. For example, the canvas
        API does not permit sampling of a canvas, or conversion to an accessible form if it is not
        origin-clean [[2DCONTEXT]].
      </p>
      <p>
        This issue is discussed in further detail in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]] and
        [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Display capture that includes browser windows, particularly those that are under any form
        of control by the application, risks violation of these basic security protections. This
        risk is not entirely contained to browser windows, since control channels between browser
        applications and other applications, depending on the operating system. The key
        consideration is whether the captured <a>display surface</a> could be somehow induced to
        present information that would otherwise be secret from the application that is receiving
        the resulting media.

          Capturing Logical or Visible Display Surfaces
        </h2>
        <p>
          Capture of <a>logical display surfaces</a> causes there to be a potential for content to
          be shared that a user is not made aware of. A <a>logical display surface</a> might render
          information that a user did not intend to expose. This can be more easily recognized if
          this information is visible. Such means are likely ineffectual against a machine, but a
          human recipient is less able to process content that appears only briefly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information that is not currently rendered to the screen SHOULD be obscured in captures
          unless the application has been specifically authorized to access that content (this
          might require <a>elevated permissions</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          How obscured areas of the <a>logical display surface</a> are captured to produce a
          <a>visible display surface</a> capture MAY vary. Some applications, like presentation
          software, benefit from having obscured portions of the screen render the image that
          appeared prior to being obscured. Freezing images can cause visual artifacts for changing
          content, or hide the fact that content is being obscured. Note that frozen portions of a
          capture can be incorrectly perceived as a bug. Alternatively, obscured areas might be
          replaced with content that marks them as being obscured, such as a grey color or
          hatching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some systems MAY only capture the <a>logical display surface</a>. Devices with small
          screens, for instance, do not typically have the concept of a <a>window</a>, and render
          applications in full screen modes only. These systems might provide a capture of an
          application that is not currently visible, which could be unusable without capturing the
          <a>logical display surface</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important consideration when capturing a <a>window</a> or other <a>display surface</a>
          that is partially transparent is that content from the background might be shared. A
          <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT capture content from the background of a captured <a>display
          surface</a>.

          Authorizing Display Capture
        </h2>
        <p>
          This document provides recommends that implementations provide additional limitations on
          the mechanisms used to affirm user consent. These limitations are designed to mitigate
          the security and privacy risks that the API poses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two forms of consent interaction are described: <a>active user consent</a> and a range of
          <a>elevated permissions</a>. These are non-normative recommendations only.
        </p>

          <h2>
            Active User Consent
          </h2>
          <p>
            <dfn>Active user consent</dfn> is sufficient where there is little or no risk of an
            application gaining information that the user did not intend to share. These cases can
            be identified by those where the application that requests capture has no control over
            what is rendered to the captured <a>display surface</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prevent applications from limiting the available choices presented to a user with
            the goal of promoting a particular choice, the <code><a>getDisplayMedia</a></code> API
            does not permit the use of constraints to narrow the set of options presented.

            Elevated Permissions
          </h2>
          <p>
            It is strongly advised that <dfn>elevated permissions</dfn> be required to access any
            <a>display surface</a> that might be used to circumvent cross-origin protections for
            content. The key goal of this consent process is not just to demonstrate that a user
            intends to share content, but to also to determine that the user exhibits an elevated
            level of trust in the application that is being granted access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several different controls might be provided to grant <a>elevated permissions</a>. This
            section describes several different capabilities that could be independently granted. A
            <a>user agent</a> might opt to prohibit access to any capability that requires
            <a>elevated permissions</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If access to these surfaces is supported, it is strongly advised that any mechanism to
            acquire <a>elevated permissions</a> not rely solely on simple prompts for user consent.
            Any action needs to ensure that a decision to authorize an application with elevated
            privileges is deliberate. For instance, a <a>user agent</a> might require a process
            equivalent to software installation to signify that user consent for <a>elevated
            permissions</a> is granted.
          </p>
          <p>
            An <a>elevated permissions</a> experience could allow the <a>user agent</a> to
            communicate the risks associated with enabling this feature, or at least to convey the
            need for augmented trust in the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that <a>elevated permissions</a> are not a substitute for <a>active user
            consent</a>. It is advised that <a>user agents</a> still present users with the ability
            to select what is shared, even for applications that have <a>elevated permissions</a>.

          <h2>
            Capabilities Depending on Elevated Permissions
          </h2>
          <p>
            <a>Elevated permissions</a> are recommended as a prerequisite for access to capture of
            <a>monitor</a> or <a>browser</a> <a>display surfaces</a>. Note that capture of a
            complete <a>monitor</a> is included because this could include a window from the
            <a>user agent</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, <a>elevated permissions</a> are a recommended prerequisite for access to
            <a>logical display surfaces</a>, where that would not ordinarily be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <a>user agent</a> SHOULD persist any <a>elevated permissions</a> that are granted to
            an origin. An <a>elevated permissions</a> process in part relies on its novelty to
            ensure that it correctly captures user intent.

        <h2>
          Feedback and Interface During Capture
        </h2>
        <p>
          Implementations are advised to provide user feedback and control mechanisms similar to
          those offered users when sharing a camera or microphone, as recommended in
          [[GETUSERMEDIA]].
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important that a user be aware that content is being shared when content is
          actively being captured. <a>User agents</a> are advised to display a prominent indicator
          while content is being captured. In addition to an indicator, a <a>user agent</a> is
          advised to provide a means to learn precisely what is being shared; while this capability
          is trivially provided by an application by rendering the captured content, this
          information allows a user to accurately assess what is being shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to feedback mechanisms, a means to for the user to stop any active capture is
          advisable.
