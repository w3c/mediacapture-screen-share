    <p>This document defines how a user's display, or parts thereof, can be used
    as the source of a media stream using getDisplayMedia, an extension to the Media Capture API
    [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>
  </section>

    <p>This document is not complete. It is subject to major changes and, while
    early experimentations are encouraged, it is therefore not intended for

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This document describes an extension to the Media Capture API
    [[GETUSERMEDIA]] that enables the acquisition of a user's display, or part
    thereof, in the form of a video stream.  This enables a number of
    applications, including screen sharing using WebRTC [[WEBRTC]].</p>

    <p>This feature has signficant security implications.  Applications that use
    this API to access information that is displayed to users could access
    confidential information from other origins if that information is under the
    control of the application.  This includes content that would otherwise be
    inaccessible due to the protections offered by the user agent sandbox.</p>

    <p>This document concerns itself primarily with the capture of video, but
    the general mechanisms defined here could be extended to other types of
    media, of which audio [[GETUSERMEDIA]] and depth [[MEDIACAPTURE-DEPTH]] are
    currently defined.</p>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn data-lt="user agents">user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>

    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]] to implement the APIs
    defined in this specification must implement them in a manner consistent
    with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification
    [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that specification and
    terminology.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>The following example demonstrates a request for display capture using
    the <code>navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia</code> method defined in
    this document.</p>

    <pre class="example highlight">
navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({ video: true })
  .then(stream => {
    // we have a stream, attach it to a feedback video element
    videoElement.srcObject = stream;
  }, error => {
    console.log("Unable to acquire screen capture", error);
  });
</pre>

  <section>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>This document uses the definition
    of <code><dfn><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#navigatorusermedia">NavigatorUserMedia</a></dfn></code>, <code><dfn><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#mediastreamtrack">MediaStreamTrack</a></dfn></code>,
    and <code><dfn><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#interface-definition">ConstrainablePattern</a></dfn></code>
    from [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>

    <p>Screen capture encompasses the capture of several different types of
    screen-based surfaces.  Collectively, these are referred to
    as <dfn data-lt="display surface">display surfaces</dfn>, of which this
    document defines the following types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <dfn>monitor</dfn> <a>display surface</a> represents a physical
      display. Some systems have multiple <a>monitor</a>s, which can be
      identified separately.  Multiple <a>monitor</a>s might also be aggregated
      into as a single logical <a>monitor</a>.  An aggregated <a>display
      surface</a> is captured as a
      single <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>.</li>

      <li>A <dfn data-lt="windows">window</dfn> <a>display surface</a> is a
      single contiguous surface that is used by a single application.</li>

      <li>A single application might have several <a>windows</a> available to
      it, and those can be aggregated into a single <dfn>application</dfn>
      surface, representing all the windows available to that application and
      therefore presented as a single <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>.</li>

      <li>A <dfn>browser</dfn> <a>display surface</a> is the rendered form of a
      single document.  This is not strictly limited to HTML [[HTML5]]
      documents, though the discussion in this document will address some
      specific concerns with the capture of HTML.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This document draws a distinction between two variants of each type of
    display surface:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <dfn data-lt="logical display surfaces">logical display surface</dfn>
      is the surface that an operating system makes available to an application
      for the purposes of rendering.</li>

      <li>a <dfn>visible display surface</dfn> is the portion of a <a>logical
      display surface</a> that is rendered to a <a>monitor</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some operating systems permit windows from different applications to
    occlude other windows, in whole or part, so the <a>visible display
    surface</a> is a strict subset of the <a>logical display surface</a>.</p>

      -->

    <p>Capture of displayed media is enabled through the addition of a
    new <code><dfn>getDisplayMedia</dfn></code> method on the
    <code><a>NavigatorUserMedia</a></code> interface, that is similar
    to <code><dfn><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#local-content">getUserMedia</a></dfn></code>
    [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>

    <p><code><a>getDisplayMedia</a></code> supports all constraints that are
    defined for use with <code><a>getUserMedia</a></code>, however it does not
    use these constraints to select a specific source or to narrow the set of
    options for source selection (see <a href="#constraints"></a>).  Two new
    constraints allow an application to observe what type of information was
    acquired.</p>

      <h2><code>NavigatorUserMedia</code> Additions</h2>

      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface NavigatorUserMedia">
        <dt>Promise&lt;MediaStream> getDisplayMedia(MediaStreamConstraints constraints)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This method operates identically to <code>getUserMedia</code>,
          except that it acquires media from output devices.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="constraints">Constraining Display Surface Selection</h2>

      <p>The <code><a>getDisplayMedia</a></code> function permits the use of
      constraints in the same way that constraints are defined
      for <code><a>getUserMedia</a></code>.  However, these constraints MUST NOT
      constrain the selection of choices that are presented to users in the same
      way.</p>

      <p>Once a <a>display surface</a> has been selected, constraints apply to
      the <a>MediaStreamTrack</a> instances that are returned.  This allows for
      changes such as adjustments to frame rate or resolution, or other
      constraints.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>New Constraints for Captured Display Surfaces</h2>
        <p>Three constraints are defined that allow an application to observe
        properties of the selected <a>display surface</a>.  Since the source of
        media cannot be changed after a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> has been
        returned, these constraints cannot be changed by an application.</p>

        <p>The <code><a href="#widl-MediaTrackConstraintSet-disableLocalEcho">disableLocalEcho</a></code>
        constraint allows an application to suppress local playback of the captured audio.</p>

        <p>The <code><a href="#widl-MediaTrackConstraintSet-displaySurface">displaySurface</a></code>
        constraint allows an application to observe the type of <a>display
        surface</a> that is being captured.</p>

        <p>The <code><a href="#widl-MediaTrackConstraintSet-logicalSurface">logicalSurface</a></code>
        constraint allows an application to express a preference or requirement
        to capture the <a>logical display surface</a>, rather than
        the <a>visible display surface</a>.</p>

        <dl class="idl" title="partial dictionary MediaTrackConstraintSet">
          <dt>ConstrainBoolean disableLocalEcho</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>A value of <code>true</code> indicates that we mute the local
            playback for the captured content. For example, when capturing a
            browser tab, the tab will be muted then; when capturing the full
            screen with audio, then the system audio will be muted then.</p>

          <dt>ConstrainBoolean logicalSurface</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>A value of <code>true</code> indicates capture of a

            indicates a capture capture of a <a>visible display
            surface</a>.</p>

      <h2>Device Identifiers</h2>

      <p>Each potential source of capture is treated by this API as a discrete
      media source.  However, display capture sources MUST NOT be enumerated by
      <code><a
      href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#widl-MediaDevices-enumerateDevices-Promise-sequence-MediaDeviceInfo">enumerateDevices</a></code>,
      since this would reveal too much information about the host system.</p>

      <p>Display capture sources MUST NOT be selected with the
      <code>deviceId</code> constraint, since this would allow applications to
      influence selection.  A display capture source is represented in the
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> API as having a <code>deviceId</code>
      parameter that is randomized each time a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is
      connected.  The only other constraint on this value is that it cannot
      duplicate any existing values for <code>deviceId</code>.</p>

    <h2>Security and Permissions</h2>

    <p>This section is informative; however, it notes some serious risks to
    platform security if the advice it contains are not adhered to.</p>

    <p class="issue">This is consistent with other documents, but the absence of
    strong normative language here is a little worrying.</p>

    <p>The risks to user privacy and security posed by capture of displayed
    content are twofold.  The immediate and obvious risk is that users
    inadvertently share content that they did not wish to share, or might not
    have realized would be shared.</p>

    <p>Display capture presents a less obvious risk to the cross site request
    forgery protections offered by the browser sandbox.  Display and capture of
    information that is also under the control of an application, even
    indirectly, can allow that application to access information that would
    otherwise by inaccessible to it directly.  For example, the canvas API does
    not permit sampling of a canvas, or conversion to an accessible form if it
    is not origin-clean [[2DCONTEXT]].</p>

    <p>This issue is discussed in further detail in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]]
    and [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY]].</p>

    <p>Display capture that includes browser windows, particularly those that
    are under any form of control by the application, risks violation of these
    basic security protections.  Though this risk is not entirely contained to
    browser windows, since control channels between browser applications and
    other applications, depending on the operating system.  The key
    consideration is whether the captured <a>display surface</a> could be
    somehow induced to present information that would otherwise be secret from
    the application that is receiving the resulting media.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Capturing Logical or Visible Display Surfaces</h2>

      <p>Capture of <a>logical display surfaces</a> causes there to be a
      potential for content to be shared that a user is not made aware of.  A
      <a>logical display surface</a> might render information that a user did
      not intend to expose.  This can be more easily recognized if this
      information is visible.  Such means are likely ineffectual against a
      machine, but a human recipient is less able to process content that
      appears only briefly.</p>

      <p>Information that is not currently rendered to the screen SHOULD be
      obscured in captures unless the application has been specifically
      authorized to access that content (this might require <a>elevated
      permissions</a>).</p>

      <p>How obscured areas of the <a>logical display surface</a> are captured
      to produce a <a>visible display surface</a> capture MAY vary.  Some
      applications, like presentation software, benefit from having obscured
      portions of the screen render the image that appeared prior to being
      obscured.  Freezing images can cause visual artifacts for changing
      content, or hide the fact that content is being obscured.  Note that
      frozen portions of a capture can be incorrectly perceived as a bug.
      Alternatively, obscured areas might be replaced with content that marks
      them as being obscured, such as a grey color or hatching.</p>

      <p>Some systems MAY only capture the <a>logical display surface</a>.
      Devices with small screens, for instance, do not typically have the
      concept of a <a>window</a>, and render applications in full screen modes
      only.  These systems might provide a capture of an application that is not
      currently visible, which could be unusable without capturing the
      <a>logical display surface</a>.</p>

      <p>An important consideration when capturing a <a>window</a> or other
      <a>display surface</a> that is partially transparent is that content from
      the background might be shared.  A <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT capture
      content from the background of a captured <a>display surface</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Authorizing Display Capture</h2>

      <p>This document provides recommends that implementations provide
      additional limitations on the mechanisms used to affirm user
      consent. These limitations are designed to mitigate the security and
      privacy risks that the API poses.</p>

      <p>Two forms of consent interaction are described: <a>active user
      consent</a> and a range of <a>elevated permissions</a>.  These are
      non-normative recommandations only.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Active User Consent</h2>

        <p><dfn>Active user consent</dfn> is sufficient where there is little or no
        risk of an application gaining information that the user did not intend
        to share.  These cases can be identified by those where the application
        that requests capture has no control over what is rendered to the
          captured <a>display surface</a>.</p>

        <p>To prevent applications from limiting the available choices presented
        to a user with the goal of promoting a particular choice,
        the <code><a>getDisplayMedia</a></code> API does not permit the use of
        constraints to narrow the set of options presented.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Elevated Permissions</h2>

        <p>It is strongly advised that <dfn>elevated permissions</dfn> be
        required to access any <a>display surface</a> that might be used to
        circumvent cross-origin protections for content.  The key goal of this
        consent process is not just to demonstrate that a user intends to share
        content, but to also to determine that the user exhibits an elevated
        level of trust in the application that is being granted access.</p>

        <p>Several different controls might be provided to grant <a>elevated
        permissions</a>.  This section describes several different capabilities
        that could be independently granted.  A <a>user agent</a> might opt to
        prohibit access to any capability that requires <a>elevated
        permissions</a>.</p>

        <p>If access to these surfaces is supported, it is strongly advised that
        any mechanism to acquire <a>elevated permissions</a> not rely solely on
        simple prompts for user consent.  Any action needs to ensure that a
        decision to authorize an application with elevated privileges is
        deliberate.  For instance, a <a>user agent</a> might require a process
        equivalent to software installation to signify that user consent for
        <a>elevated permissions</a> is granted.</p>

        <p>An <a>elevated permissions</a> experience could allow the <a>user
        agent</a> to communicate the risks associated with enabling this
        feature, or at least to convey the need for augmented trust in the
        application.</p>

        <p>Note that <a>elevated permissions</a> are not a substitute for
        <a>active user consent</a>.  It is advised that <a>user agents</a> still
        present users with the ability to select what is shared, even for
        applications that have <a>elevated permissions</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Capabilities Depending on Elevated Permissions</h2>

        <p><a>Elevated permissions</a> are recommended as a prerequisite for
        access to capture of <a>monitor</a> or <a>browser</a> <a>display
        surfaces</a>.  Note that capture of a complete <a>monitor</a> is included
        because this could include a window from the <a>user agent</a>.</p>

        <p>Similarly, <a>elevated permissions</a> are a recommended prerequisite
        for access to <a>logical display surfaces</a>, where that would not
        ordinarily be provided.</p>

        <p>A <a>user agent</a> SHOULD persist any <a>elevated permissions</a>
        that are granted to an origin. An <a>elevated permissions</a> process in
        part relies on its novelty to ensure that it correctly captures user
        intent.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Feedback and Interface During Capture</h2>

      <p>Implementations are advised to provide user feedback and control
      mechanisms similar to those offered users when sharing a camera or
      microphone, as recommended in [[GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>

      <p>It is important that a user be aware that content is being shared when
      content is actively being captured.  <a>User agents</a> are advised to
      display a prominent indicator while content is being captured.  In
      addition to an indicator, a <a>user agent</a> is advised to provide a
      means to learn precisely what is being shared; while this capability is
      trivially provided by an application by rendering the captured content,
      this information allows a user to accurately assess what is being
      shared.</p>

      <p>In addition to feedback mechanisms, a means to for the user to
      stop any active capture is advisable.</p>
